Hangman Reqs

* Input a word and break it apart into individual letters

* When a user selects a letter that is correct, place that letter into the console

* When a user select a letter that is wrong, then decrement the number of guesses left and print that letter to the Guessed Letter areas

- When all of the letters are selected correctly, then increment the Wins count

- When there are no more letter to select and the user has not won, then increment the Losses count

Whether win or lose, reset the game to another letter
